# ADR 4. Make API for Library names

August 12, 2021

## Context

While developing applications for the library there are many times when applications need to know the official spelling of libraries and locations. Generally these strings are hardcoded and are inevitably inconsistent accross our applications.

As a developer we want to be able to have a programatic way of determining these constants. 

## Decision

We will create a web API that contains this information.

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

* Developers will know where to go to find spellings for libraries and locations.
* Decision makers will have one place to update this information
* Time will need to be spent building the application, keeping it well documented, and keeping it backwards compatible
* Older applications should be refactored to use the API instead of hardcoding these values
